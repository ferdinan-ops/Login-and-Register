# Login and Register
Login and register advanced projects from the game dashboard. I created a login and register form to complete the game dashboard that I have published. I also made a very attractive display design and matched the theme that I had created on the game project dashboard that I had created. This project is open to anyone who wants to develop it.

In this login and register project I use Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for IDE with Visual Basic programming language for programing language, GUNA UI for framework, and MySQL for database.
